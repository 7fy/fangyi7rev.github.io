( if assumed structure is wrong, standard errors will systematically too large or too small) robust standard errors based on the product of the sums of the residuals within panels. negative within-panel correlation results in a smaller product of sums than would be obtained under independence. positive within-panel correlation results in a larger product of sums than would be obtained under independence. Note: It is not appropriate to choose one model over the other just because the standard errors are smaller! Note: if we use ‘empirical’ standard errors then we don’t need to rely on the model to give us good standard errors (in many cases). comparing results under different correlation structuresthe model-based standard errors (SEs) were often very different to the empirical standard errors (ESEs) 总共分了三种correlation matrixs: independent correlation structure, AR(1), unsructured.（怎么比较好坏？ 看se 和ese 对比，如果差不多说明合适） model selectionGEEs use QL (quasi-likelihood)QL based or QIC scores. QICu choose between models with different sets of covariates QIC(R) choose between models with the same covariates but different correlation structures. $ \ beta_R $ is the set of coefficients obtained under some specified correlation structure R model assessing for GEEs if the size of the panels is small and the data are complete, use the unstructured specification if the observations within panels are collected across time use a corrleation structure that also incudes a time dependence. if the observations are clustered (but not collected over time) use the exchangeeable/ compound symmetry structure. if the numbers of panels is small then the independence model may be best. we could not only choose model by QIC(R), should also consider the SE issue. assess the relationship is appropriate using cumulative sums of residuals over a set of co-ordinates. (systematic over or under-predition across the covariate being considered tell us a problem with linearity) the cumulative residuals based on the model are compared with sets of cumulative residuals which are likely to be obtained if the linear model is appropriate. a discrepancy between the simulated sets and the cumulative residuals for our model, give evidence that the model is inappropriate. this discrepancy between model residuals and those expected under a linear model return a p-value. (small p-value signify a problem with the linear model. p大linear) assessing influential points and individualsdeletion diagnostics assess influence of individual data points and influential individuals Cook’s distance measute assess points outlyingis a scaled measure of the distance between the coefficient vectors when the k-th group of observations is deleted from the analysis.independence working model does not appear to have any wildly large cook’s distance value.to reduce concerns about influential individuals, one or more individuals assessing predictive power$ R^2 $ or concordance correlation (concordance correlation coefficient measures the agreement between two variablesThe concordance correlation coefficient is nearly identical to some of the measures called intra-class correlations. ) hypothesis testingWald test (H0: $ \beta_j = 0 $) To test if one of the slope coefficients (βj) is zero]]></content>
