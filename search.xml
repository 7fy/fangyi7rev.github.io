Systematic Samples (with a random start) sample n units from N poulation.$k = N/n $randomly pick a number between each $x$ and $x+k$ Stratified Random Samples divide the population into different categories, then take different SRSs from each category. Data types in Statistics Quantitative: numerical valued Continuous: infinite number of possible values Discrete: count data, data with gaps between values Qualitative: non-numerical valued Ordinal（定序）: nonnummeric but relative values Nominal（定类）: unordered.distinct by name only Summary Statistics Mean: $\bar x = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^nx_i}{n} $ Median: the middle value in the sample sorted in ascending order. Mode: the value/bin with the highest frequency. mean is sensitive to outliers. median is robust to outliers. median more appropriate with highly skewed data. Standard deviation: $s=\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\bar x)^2}{n-1}}$ Variance: $Std^2$ Probability The probability of an event $ A \in S $, denoted $Pr(A)$ is a number between $0$ and $1$. $Pr(S)=1$ if $A_1,A_2,\cdots, A_k $ are a finite collection of mutually exclusive envents（互斥事件）, then $$Pr(A_1\cup A_2 \cup \cdots \cup A_k )= \sum_{i=1}^kPr(A_i)$$ if $A_1,A_2,\cdots $ are an infinite collection of mutually exclusive envents（互斥事件）, then $$Pr(A_1\cup A_2 \cup \cdots )= \sum_{i=1}^\infty Pr(A_i)$$Thus $Pr(A^c)=1-Pr(A)$ If A and B are mutually exclusive, then $Pr(A \cap B) = 0$ $Pr(A\cup B)=Pr(A)+Pr(B)-Pr(A \cap B)$ if two events A and B are independent, then $$Pr(A and B)=Pr(A)*Pr(B)$$ The probability an event A occurs given that another event B is denoted $Pr(A\mid B)$$$Pr(A\mid B) = \frac{Pr(A \cap B)}{Pr(B)}$$ General Multiplication rule: $$Pr(G \cap F)=Pr(G \mid F)Pr(F)$$Law of Large Number （大数定律）） If a random process is repeated in an identical and independent manner, the observed relateive frequency of outcomes will converge to the expected or “true” relative frequency.

( if assumed structure is wrong, standard errors will systematically too large or too small) robust standard errors based on the product of the sums of the residuals within panels. negative within-panel correlation results in a smaller product of sums than would be obtained under independence. positive within-panel correlation results in a larger product of sums than would be obtained under independence. Note: It is not appropriate to choose one model over the other just because the standard errors are smaller! Note: if we use ‘empirical’ standard errors then we don’t need to rely on the model to give us good standard errors (in many cases). comparing results under different correlation structuresthe model-based standard errors (SEs) were often very different to the empirical standard errors (ESEs) 总共分了三种correlation matrixs: independent correlation structure, AR(1), unsructured.（怎么比较好坏？ 看se 和ese 对比，如果差不多说明合适） model selectionGEEs use QL (quasi-likelihood)QL based or QIC scores. QICu choose between models with different sets of covariates QIC(R) choose between models with the same covariates but different correlation structures. $ \ beta_R $ is the set of coefficients obtained under some specified correlation structure R model assessing for GEEs if the size of the panels is small and the data are complete, use the unstructured specification if the observations within panels are collected across time use a corrleation structure that also incudes a time dependence. if the observations are clustered (but not collected over time) use the exchangeeable/ compound symmetry structure. if the numbers of panels is small then the independence model may be best. we could not only choose model by QIC(R), should also consider the SE issue. assess the relationship is appropriate using cumulative sums of residuals over a set of co-ordinates. (systematic over or under-predition across the covariate being considered tell us a problem with linearity) the cumulative residuals based on the model are compared with sets of cumulative residuals which are likely to be obtained if the linear model is appropriate. a discrepancy between the simulated sets and the cumulative residuals for our model, give evidence that the model is inappropriate. this discrepancy between model residuals and those expected under a linear model return a p-value.
